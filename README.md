# quiz_API
A little fastAPI project to pull from a 'database' of questions

The questions are in the file quesitons.csv, which was obtained this way:
wget https://dst-de.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/fastapi_fr/questions.csv

execute lauchapp.sh to automatically install requirements and start uvicorn
api can be seen at http://localhost:8000
